# Contributing to AI-Powered-Poetic-Image-Caption-Matching

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **AI-Powered-Poetic-Image-Caption-Matching** project!  
This repository is focused on building an AI system that intelligently matches images with poetic, creative captions using natural language and vision models. Whether you’re enhancing model architecture, polishing data pipelines, or improving documentation, your contribution matters and is greatly appreciated.



## 🚀 How You Can Contribute

### 🧠 Model Improvements
- Improve or experiment with transformer-based models for image–text matching.  
- Explore state-of-the-art architectures like CLIP, ViLT, BLIP, or multi-modal transformers.  
- Tune hyperparameters for better semantic alignment and caption quality.

### 📊 Data Enhancements
- Add new caption–image pairs or expand datasets with curated creative content.  
- Improve data preprocessing, cleaning, or augmentation pipelines.  
- Add cross-validation datasets for robust evaluation.

### 🛠 Tools & Pipeline
- Modularise data processing and modelling scripts.  
- Add automated evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, SPICE).  
- Provide reusable notebooks or scripts for training and testing.

### 🌟 Documentation & Tutorials
- Improve the README with clear instructions.  
- Add **How to Train**, **How to Evaluate**, or **How to Deploy** guides.  
- Add example outputs and visuals demonstrating model predictions.

### 📈 Visualization & UI
- Build dashboards or UI (web/desktop) to demo model predictions.  
- Add interactive charts of evaluation metrics or embedding spaces.
